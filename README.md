### How to use the Plugin
There are two ways of using this tool. You can simply use the C++ Actor or you can create a Blueprint class out of it.

#### Using the C++ Actor
Drag the AudioSpline Actor into the world and add as many spline points as you need.
To add a spline point drag one of the X,Y,Z arrows while holding alt key on your keyboard. Alternatevely you can add a spline point anywhere on the spline by right click on it.
